# SDK Course Guides

These short guides are designed for learners who installed the SDK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install open-data-products
```

These exercises are part of the Open Data Products SDK MasterClass on Udemy.

The first four guides do not use an LLM. They cover validation, explanation,
vocabulary lookup, and graph conversion.

The last four guides use the SDK generation command. They require Ollama with
Qwen 2.5 or a configured online provider.
